# Bhagaskara
Front-end practice project done during the Coderslab course.

Project done during the CodersLab bootcamp using custom-made grid.
Done with HTML5, Sass, javascript with jquery. NO other frameworks/libraries used.
Still not finished.

Sticky menu done with javascript/jquery.
Slider in "Our team" done with javascript/jquery.
Slider in "services" (with citations) done in css3, although choosing desired citation done in js/jquery.
Gallery in "our portfolio" done with js/jquery.

Note that button "blog" in menu should redirect to another page that was not included in this practice design, hence its not working.

NOTE: When running from local drive using Chrome, chossing citation by clicking on dot doesn't work due to know security/bug issues, but works fine when chrome run through IDE (localhost:../)(tested on Webstorm).
More info about above issue: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=49001 or https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=45786

#To do:
- add random photos instead of grey circles (for better presentation)
- add more pictures to gallery for testing
